# Vector Store Benchmarks

This document presents comprehensive benchmarks for the Vector Store implementation, focusing on performance characteristics across different operations and scales.

## Performance Hypotheses

### 1. Batch Insertion Performance
| Metric | Excellent | Good | Baseline |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|
| 100 vectors | < 10ms | < 20ms | < 50ms |
| 1,000 vectors | < 100ms | < 200ms | < 500ms |
| 10,000 vectors | < 1s | < 2s | < 5s |
| Throughput | > 10K vectors/s | > 5K vectors/s | > 2K vectors/s |

**Rationale:**
- Memory allocation and index updates are our primary bottlenecks
- Rust's zero-cost abstractions should provide near-optimal performance
- HNSW construction complexity is O(log N) per insertion
- Baseline numbers derived from FAISS and Milvus benchmarks

### 2. Concurrent Search Performance
| Metric | Excellent | Good | Baseline |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|
| Latency (p95) | < 1ms | < 5ms | < 10ms |
| Throughput | > 10K QPS | > 5K QPS | > 1K QPS |
| Concurrent Users | > 100 | > 50 | > 20 |

**Rationale:**
- Search complexity is O(log N) in HNSW
- Rust's async runtime should handle concurrency efficiently
- Memory access patterns are optimized for cache locality
- Baseline derived from production HNSW implementations

### 3. Large-Scale Operations
| Metric | Excellent | Good | Baseline |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|
| 100K vectors | < 10s | < 30s | < 60s |
| 500K vectors | < 45s | < 90s | < 180s |
| 1M vectors | < 90s | < 180s | < 360s |
| Memory Usage | < 2GB/1M vectors | < 4GB/1M vectors | < 8GB/1M vectors |

**Rationale:**
- Linear scaling with slight overhead for larger datasets
- Memory efficiency from Rust's ownership model
- Cache-friendly data structures should maintain performance
- Baseline numbers from similar vector databases
