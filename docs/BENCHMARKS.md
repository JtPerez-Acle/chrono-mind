# Benchmarks

Two comparisons: internal (our lock-free index vs our own locked
baselines — isolates the concurrency-control variable) and external
(vs other open-source ANN libraries — locates us in the field).

## Where we stand: external head-to-head

`cargo bench --bench external --features bench-external` — five systems,
identical seeded data (10,000 × 768-d embedding-like vectors, unit norm),
identical parameters (M=16, efC=100, efS=50 or each library's nearest
equivalent), f32 everywhere, recall measured against shared brute-force
ground truth. Ranges over two runs (i7-12700KF, Windows 11):

| system | build 1T | build parallel | QPS 1T | QPS 8T | recall@10 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **chronomind (lock-free)** | 4.7–5.2s | **0.61–0.70s** | **3,393–4,231** | **29,038–33,824** | 0.998 |
| chrono-sharded16 | 2.2–2.6s | 0.30–0.34s | 393–449 | 3,487–3,526 | 1.000 |
| instant-distance 0.6 | — (bulk only) | 6.9–7.3s | 1,031–1,153 | 9,325–9,437 | 1.000 |
| hnsw_rs 0.3.4 | 14.1–14.6s | 1.27–1.36s (rayon) | 1,169–1,225 | 6,957–7,306 | 0.969–0.973 |
| usearch 2.25 (C++) | 4.0–5.0s | 0.53–0.55s | 3,093–3,965 | 28,757–30,961 | 0.997–0.998 |

Reading it honestly:

- **Search throughput is at parity with usearch** — the SIMD-heavy C++
  engine — within run-to-run noise (each run had a different leader), at
  identical recall. Both are ~3–4× faster than the pure-Rust crates.
- **Parallel build is competitive with usearch** (~20% slower) and
  ~2× faster than hnsw_rs's rayon build; our single-thread build is
  mid-pack.
- **Recall is top-tier**: 0.998 vs ground truth, above hnsw_rs (~0.97) at
  the same nominal parameters.
- Only chronomind, hnsw_rs, and usearch support incremental insert;
  instant-distance is bulk-build-only, and only chronomind and usearch
  support deletes. Among the contenders, only chronomind's reads are
  wait-free under concurrent writers.

Scope caveats, stated plainly: one dataset shape (synthetic, low intrinsic
dimension — chosen to model embeddings), one size (10k), one machine, f32
only. usearch ships i8/bf16 quantization that would shrink its memory and
beat everyone's f32 throughput — disabled here for apples-to-apples. This
is not an ann-benchmarks run on SIFT/GIST at million scale; treat it as a
strong local signal, not a leaderboard entry.

## Internal A/B: lock-free vs our own locked baselines

A/B comparison of the lock-free HNSW index (`LockFreeHnsw`) against the
RwLock baseline (`RwLockHnsw`) — same algorithm, same parameters, different
concurrency control.

### Method

- `cargo bench` (criterion 0.5), bench target `benches/comparison.rs`.
- Data: 768-dimensional unit vectors confined to a random 16-d subspace
  ("embedding-like" — real embeddings have low intrinsic dimensionality;
  uniform 768-d noise is not a representative workload).
- Index parameters: M = 16, efConstruction = 100, efSearch = 50.
- Workloads, each at 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 threads:
  - `insert_throughput`: build a 4,000-vector index from scratch, work
    split evenly across threads.
  - `search_qps`: 2,000 queries against a pre-built 10,000-vector index.
  - `mixed_90_10`: 2,000 ops, 90% search / 10% insert, against a
    pre-built 10,000-vector index. One index per thread-count
    configuration; the 10% inserts accumulate across criterion samples
    (bounded, ~200/iteration on a 10k corpus) rather than rebuilding per
    sample, which would make graph construction dominate the timing.
- Sizes are deliberately minutes-scale: the meaningful signal is the
  *relative scaling under contention* of the implementations, which is
  stable across corpus size; absolute numbers vary with hardware. (These
  criterion measurements run a touch lower than the external suite's
  best-of-three QPS — e.g. ~26K vs ~29K search at 8T — because criterion
  reports a full-distribution estimate, not the best pass.)

### Contenders

- `lockfree` — the lock-free index (`LockFreeHnsw`)
- `rwlock` — the same algorithm behind one `RwLock` (`RwLockHnsw`)
- `sharded16` — the *fair* baseline (`ShardedRwLockHnsw`): 16 independently
  locked shards, round-robin inserts, scatter-gather search. This is what a
  practitioner would actually deploy to make a locked design scale writes.

### Results

Machine: Intel i7-12700KF (12 cores / 20 threads), Windows 11, Rust stable
1.93, June 2026. Ops/sec (criterion mid-estimates), all three columns from
one coherent run.

### insert_throughput — 4,000 concurrent inserts

| threads | lock-free | RwLock | sharded16 |
|--------:|----------:|-------:|----------:|
| 1 | 2,471 | 2,498 | 7,984 |
| 2 | 4,538 | 2,751 | 14,220 |
| 4 | 9,488 | 2,775 | 23,262 |
| 8 | 18,639 | 2,853 | 44,913 |

### search_qps — 2,000 queries, 10,000-vector index, no writers

| threads | lock-free | RwLock | sharded16 |
|--------:|----------:|-------:|----------:|
| 1 | 3,618 | 3,642 | 393 |
| 2 | 6,806 | 7,396 | 905 |
| 4 | 13,262 | 14,478 | 1,665 |
| 8 | 26,256 | 27,050 | 3,506 |

### mixed_90_10 — 2,000 ops, 90% search / 10% insert

| threads | lock-free | RwLock | sharded16 |
|--------:|----------:|-------:|----------:|
| 1 | 16,039 | 22,106 | 529 |
| 2 | 38,337 | 20,335 | 1,120 |
| 4 | 66,440 | 16,298 | 2,110 |
| 8 | 114,570 | 22,621 | 5,204 |

The lockfree/rwlock shapes were reproduced across three separate `cargo
bench` sessions (absolute numbers drift ~±15% with machine state; ordering
and scaling shape agree). The sharded16 deltas are order-of-magnitude —
far beyond session variance.

### Reading the three-way comparison

- **Sharding wins pure construction, honestly.** Round-robin over 16
  shards means each insert searches a graph 1/16th the size *and* writers
  rarely contend — 2.4× over lock-free at 8 threads. If your workload is
  bulk-load-then-freeze, shard it.
- **Sharding loses everything else.** Every query pays 16 sub-searches
  plus a merge: 9× slower on pure search at 1 thread (7.5× at 8 threads,
  where lock-free's read scaling narrows the gap), and 22× slower on the
  mixed workload at 8 threads. The read tax is structural, not tunable.
- **The single RwLock is flat wherever writes exist** — serialized
  writers can't use threads, and exclusive writers stall every reader the
  moment 10% of traffic writes.
- **The lock-free index is the only contender that wins the realistic
  workload** (search-dominated with steady writes), and the only one whose
  read latency is immune to writers (wait-free). Its concessions: ~5%
  constant read overhead vs an uncontended RwLock, and per-insert
  full-graph construction cost vs sharding's smaller graphs.
